<h1>about</h1>

<p>Hi, I’m Cristian Rus, a digital designer based in Auckland, New Zealand.</p>

<p>For more than a decade, I have focused on how design and technologies influence society and human behaviour. The goal is to communicate and find solutions from a design perspective to how customers and businesses interact.</p>

<p>Previously I worked as a tech journalist at <a href="https://webedia-group.com" target="_blank">Webedia</a> and as a designer for different companies, researching user interactions, creating interfaces and designing digital spaces.</p>

<p>The most effective way to contact me is by <a href="mailto:cristianrus@hey.com">email</a>. Otherwise, if we’re in the same city, we can have a coffee or go for a walk.</p>
