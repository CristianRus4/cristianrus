<h1>about</h1>

<p>Hey, I’m Cristian, a digital designer based in Wellington, New Zealand.</p>

<p>During my career, I have focused on how design and technology influence society and human behavior. My aim is to communicate and devise design-oriented solutions for the interactions between customers and businesses. Currently working as a designer and developing my own apps.</p>

<p>Previously I spent over five years as a tech journalist at <a href="https://webedia-group.com" target="_blank">Webedia</a> and worked as a designer for various companies conducting research on user interactions, crafting interfaces and designing digital spaces.</p>


<p>The most effective way to contact me is by email at <a href="mailto:cristianrus@hey.com">cristianrus@hey.com</a> or by call or text at <a href="tel:+642041926150">+64 20 4192 6150</a>. Otherwise, if we’re in the same city, we can have a coffee or go for a walk. Thank you for your time.</p>
