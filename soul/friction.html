      <p>Welcome to the second chapter of your journey. Begin by recognizing that friction is the way to improvement. Embrace the discomfort of waking up early, a seemingly small yet significant struggle that foreshadows the challenges ahead. As the morning light filters through the curtains, summon the determination to rise from the warmth of your bed and embark on the task at hand.</p>


<p>For this challenge, venture to Mount Eden Summit, where the serenity of nature awaits to greet you. The ascent up the trail mirrors the internal resistance you overcome with each step, a testament to your commitment to growth. Upon reaching the summit, greet the sunrise with a sense of accomplishment, knowing that you have conquered the inertia of comfort for the sake of progress.</p>

<p>Prior to starting your journey to the summit, visit a nearby coffee shop and procure a cup of coffee. While the coffee itself is not the focus, request a newspaper, as it will serve as a token of your morning pilgrimage. Once at the summit, with the newspaper in hand, capture a photo of the sunrise, ensuring the date on the newspaper is visible and the sun is still ascending, mirroring the ascent of your own spirit. This will attest to your commitment to undertaking the challenge early in the day.</p>

<p>As the day unfolds, the impact of your morning endeavor will permeate every aspect of your being. The resilience forged in the early hours infuses your actions with purpose and determination. With each challenge faced head-on, you find yourself growing stronger, more resilient, and more attuned to the transformative power of embracing discomfort.</p>

<p>To complete the task, reflect on the day's journey. How did performing this uncomfortable task at the start of the day affect you? What impact did it have on your daily routine? Articulate this in five sentences and <a href="mailto:cristianrus4@onmail.com">submit your photo along with your reflection</a> to fulfill the challenge. Embrace the struggle, Mariia, for it is through adversity that you will discover the path to self-improvement and fulfillment.</p>

      <p>A few minutes ago I have overcome a small challenge for me - which is getting up at 6:30am to go for a walk up Mount Eden to capture the sunrise at 7:15am. [...] When I got there, at first I thought I have missed the sunrise, and that Google lied to me about the time, while taking the first few photos of the pale, pink sky - but as the sky got darker and turned into more of a blood orange colour, I've realised that it's only the beginning and I got there perfectly on time.

<p>[...]<p>

<p>Reflecting on the day today, I can say that waking up early really does make a big difference in the things I can get done within that time. Counting the hours - if I normally wake up at 11:00am and go to sleep around 3:00am - which gives me around 16 hours of time to be active. Today as I woke up at 6:30am and now will probably be asleep by 12:00am - which gives me 16.5 hours of time to be active. Plus, minus - its almost the same hours. But because all the places are open during morning time and all the people are active during the day, and almost everything closed after 5pm in New Zealand, it makes sense to live during the day and get things all done during the day. I feel like I have been more productive today rather than any other day that I just usually stay in bed most of the morning and most of the next night up until 3am...<p>

<p>Walking up Mount Eden wasn't really much of a challenge for me because I actually enjoyed the walk and it doesnt matter how early it is - walking is not a challenge. But waking up early - was really the biggest challenge of the day. During the walk, for the first time in a while, I actually forgot about the AirPods and was mostly alert and focused on time, my surroundings and the people.</p>

<p>[...]<p>

<p>I wouldn't say it was a productive day, but it was a pretty nice one. Thank you.<p>

<p>Mariia, I am glad to hear that you experienced firsthand the significant difference that challenge can make in a normal day of your life. It's not merely about the act of waking up early, but rather the accomplishment of completing a challenging task. The real triumph lies in pushing through the initial discomfort and experiencing the satisfaction that comes from overcoming that hurdle. The friction and struggle you face in waking up early serve as a catalyst for personal growth and improvement. Your journey to the summit was just a vehicle; the real achievement was in breaking free from the comfort of your routine and embracing the challenge. Think of how many new things you discovered, learned and did in just a few hours compared to a normal day of your life. That huge difference of novelty it came, mostly, from doing somthing that creates friction in your life.</p>

<p>As a side note, it can be fascinating to realize that the number of waking hours remains almost the same, yet the nature of those hours can vastly differ. The productive energy and opportunities available during the morning can indeed shape your day in ways that late hours often can't. This discovery is valuable and can guide you in maximizing your daily activities in the future. It was not the main goal of this challenge, yet is something valuable you discovered through friction.</p>

<p>In the coming days, I encourage you to think about the concept "friction is the way to improvement". Actual proper thinking about it, every word and it's meaning. Consider its implications in your life and how you can harness this principle to enhance your daily actions. Embrace the struggle, for it is through these challenges that you will continue to grow and find fulfillment.</p>
