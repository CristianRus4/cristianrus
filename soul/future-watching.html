 <p>Dear mirror,</p>

 <p>It really makes sense now what "Your future self is watching you" actually means. Our life is a storyline that has beginning and an end. If we were playing our life on repeat, exactly in the middle of our every life and death, would be a barrier that splits it to prevent it from connecting the start with end. Just like a reflection in the mirror that splits the two sides with a glass. Just like a tape recording that you can play back and forward. Just like the universe - where the creatures in the movie originate from. As I am writing this paragraph, I am traveling through time, creating my life, story, memory, and being part of the universe.</p>

 <p>I believe the author's main theme of the movie was to connect and compare the palindrome characters of the unknown creatures' language to time in our lives. Although, there are other ideas that Denis Villeneuve conveys in this movie with this, such as; how powerful language and communication can be in resolving war and peace; how language and communication can develop trust, understanding, appreciation and love within a human connection; and possibly the limits of infinity. Connecting to myself, this movie made me wonder a lot about time in the world. I am questioning the meaning of infinity and the limits of freedom in my life now. </p>

<p>Your reflection about the movie is spot on. Life can be seen as a circle, with no true beginning or end, but rather everything happening simultaneously. The heptapods in "Arrival" perceive time as a circle, where past, present, and future occur concurrently. Time, in the end, is just another dimension—imagine if you could move through time as easily as you move through width, depth, and height. Imagine seeing time as you see a 3D object, all at once. Time is fascinating, primarily because we cannot fully decode it.</p>

<p>Currently, we understand time as an arrow, where the past must occur first to create the present and future. However, what if this sequence didn't matter? What if everything existed simultaneously? What if your future is observing you? Indeed, it is, just as you look back on yourself from four years ago through memories. How would your high school self feel knowing the future you is watching? How does your present self feel knowing your future self is observing? Whether you like it or not, it is happening. Your first assignment in this challenge is to consider what your future self expects from you now to avoid disappointment. Reflect on this and <a href="mailto:cristianrus4@onmail.com">express it in two sentences</a>.</p>

<p>Your second task in this assignment is to reflect on fate and destiny. This is tricky. Are we predetermined to follow a specific path in life, or can we choose our future? The protagonist in "Arrival" can see her destiny by understanding the heptapods' language and perceiving past, present, and future simultaneously. She knows her daughter will die but chooses to have her and cherish every moment, despite knowing the end. How would you live if you knew your life was predetermined? What would you do if you knew you would die in two years? Would your daily life differ from now? It might not be in two years—it could be in ten years, sixty years, or tomorrow. What are you waiting for to live the life you want? This question challenges your perception of freedom in life, as you said. <a href="mailto:cristianrus4@onmail.com">Answer it in one sentence</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, this challenge is a reflection on your time in the universe. You are insignificant in the grand scheme, yet you have one chance to make the most of it. You cannot see the future or change the past, but both are influenced by your present actions. The final question is: how are you going to act now? There is no need to reply, but choose wisely because, indeed, your future self is watching you.</p>

<p>Dear mirror,</p>


<p>Based on my present and past, I think my future self would expect from me to not give up on anything I do and be focused and committed to things that are important to me. To live my life enjoying every moment, try my best and put all my soul/mind/effort into everything I do for this world.</p>


<p>If I knew the day I die, I would live my life now the way I would want to watch it if I play it on repeat after death.</p>
