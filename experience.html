<h1>previous work</h1>


<p>For over a decade, I have focused on examining how design and technology influence society and human behavior. My aim is to communicate and devise design-oriented solutions for the interactions between customers and businesses.</p>

<p>During my career, I spent over five years as a tech journalist at <a href="https://webedia-group.com" target="_blank">Webedia</a> and worked as a designer for various companies. In these roles, I conducted research on user interactions, crafted interfaces, and designed digital spaces</p>
